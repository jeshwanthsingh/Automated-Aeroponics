# Automated Aeroponics System

## Overview
The **Automated Aeroponics System** is an **IoT-driven greenhouse solution** designed to **minimize human intervention** and **optimize plant growth conditions**. This project integrates **sensor-based monitoring**, **automated climate control**, and **data visualization** via an **online dashboard** to manage an aeroponic farming system efficiently.

## Features
- **Fully Automated Climate Control**: Regulates temperature, humidity, and light intensity.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses IoT sensors to collect and analyze data.
- **Remote Data Access**: Displays sensor data on ThingSpeak for real-time insights.
- **Automated Nutrient Delivery**: Uses a misting system for efficient nutrient dispersion.
- **Image Processing & Notifications**: Captures plant growth images and sends sensor updates via email.

## System Architecture
### **Chamber Design**
- **Shoot Chamber** (for plant growth above the roots):
  - Equipped with **light sensor**, **temperature sensor (LM35)**, and **humidity sensor (DHT11)**.
  - Contains **white LED lights (12V 5050)** controlled dynamically based on light intensity requirements.
  - Uses **exhaust fans** to regulate temperature when exceeding **22Â°C**.

- **Root Chamber** (for nutrient absorption):
  - Features **misting system** powered by a **pump**.
  - Delivers nutrients in mist form for enhanced absorption.
  - Monitored using **DHT11 sensor** for root temperature and humidity.

## Sensors and Components
- **LM35 Sensor**: Measures shoot chamber temperature.
- **DHT11 Sensor**: Monitors root chamber temperature and humidity.
- **LDR Sensor**: Measures light intensity; values are converted using MCP3008 ADC.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Controls the system and processes sensor data.
- **Pump & Mist Makers**: Deliver nutrients to the root chamber.
- **Exhaust Fans**: Regulate temperature in the shoot chamber.

## Data Processing & Cloud Integration
- **Local Data Storage**: Captures plant images and logs sensor readings.
- **Email Alerts**: Sends real-time temperature, humidity, and image updates.
- **ThingSpeak API**:
  - Uploads sensor readings for real-time data visualization.
  - Allows users to monitor system status via web or mobile app.
